my way to Front-end developers

<h1>Hello my friends. Welcome in to my repository! </h1>
My name is Aleksey, I'm from Ukraine. 
I set a goal to learn English, HTML, CSS, JS. No matter how silly it sounds, after 3 months!
I understand that it is not possible to become a qualified specialist in such a short period of time. But the idea itself is interesting, what can be learned until March 2019. And is it possible to get a remote job, for further education and gaining experience
What is the level of knowledge at the moment? I watched various training videos on Youtube for the last two weeks. I pass several free courses on HTML, CSS.
I will conduct a subjective assessment of my knowledge before and after two weeks of study:

HTML - understood that it is necessary for the structure of sites, and that it has header, footer and body)))
- I can write a primitive site. Try to make it semantically arranged (using tags for the intended purpose). Make adjustments to the existing site (not significant) With the help of browser developer tools, Google and cheat sheets)))

CSS - knew that it is written in the visual design
- I can slightly decorate the site that wrote in HTML)) or correct an existing site. With the help of Google and cheat sheets)))

JS - knowledge is close to zero
- no change, approximately understood the essence of object-oriented programming

Git - never heard before
- now I heard)) trying to figure it out. I understood the essence of version control. The technical side of the question remains


WordPress - made 3 corporate sites for small companies. I uploaded sites to the host and transferred the databases (the host and the domain also ordered) Their subsequent fate is unknown)) I made myself a simple landing page for training.
- after reading HTML and CSS, many things have become clearer

Photoshop - basic skills
-- without changes

English is poorly spoken, even worse written. Small vocabulary. I do not know grammar
- without any changes. I try to be engaged in the application on the phone every day.

Why did I write all this? That for a large extent for yourself. I plan to make some kind of blog layout, and keep my diary in it. It is unlikely that every day there to write something. But I will be eager to share my impressions, victories and defeats. Sometimes there is a lack of motivation. Or someone will find it for yourself ...

P .S. I apologize for my english. I write while with Google translator
